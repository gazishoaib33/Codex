# Codex Repository Overview

## General Structure (Current State)

At the moment, this repository contains only a placeholder file to keep the
repository non-empty:

- `.gitkeep`: Placeholder file; no source code or directories exist yet.

There are **no** application modules, build scripts, or test suites present
right now.

## Important Things to Know

- The repository is effectively empty, which means there are no conventions,
  entry points, or dependency management decisions in place yet.
- Any future structure (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`, `tests/`) and tooling (e.g.,
  language runtime, build system, CI configuration) will need to be introduced
  from scratch.

## Pointers for Things to Learn Next (Once Code Exists)

When the codebase is introduced, the most useful onboarding steps typically
include:

1. **Project entry point**: Identify how the application starts (CLI, server,
   or UI entry).
2. **Module map**: Learn the major directories/modules and the responsibilities
   of each.
3. **Build & run workflow**: Understand how to install dependencies, run the
   app, and execute tests.
4. **Development conventions**: Find style guides, linting rules, and contribution
   workflows.

If you add the code or point to another branch, this document can be updated
with concrete, code-based details.
